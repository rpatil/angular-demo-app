      A directive is really a way to teach HTML new tricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The web when it first came out was really just designed to display static pages. As we all know it’s
      become very dynamic and we’ve dealt with that pretty well. jQuery came out many years ago and it
      provided a way to do it. Even before then we could use raw, vanilla JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>Angular takes it up a whole notch and allows us to extend HTML very easily by simply adding
      attributes, elements or comments.

      Here’s an example of using a very basic, but important, Angular directive.
    </p>
    <p>    
      Notice at the top we have <bold>ng-app</bold>. Any time you see <bold>ng-</bold> that is an Angular directive. It’s a built-on
      directive. You can also write custom ones. You can get third party ones and things like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular directive is very important because the script that’s now loaded [at the bottom] is
      going to kick off and this will initialise the Angular app. Right now we don’t have any particular
      module associated or any other code but we can still do stuff just by adding <bold>ng-app</bold>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for example, this is an example of another directive called <bold>ng-model</bold>.
      What <bold>ng-model</bold> does is behind the scenes it’s going to add a property up in the memory called
      “name” into what’s called “<bold>the scope</bold>”.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you’ve ever dealt with the concept of a View’s model called a <bold>ViewModel</bold> - Knockout and some
      other libraries have this concept – then what this is really doing behind the scenes is making an
      empty ViewModel but then filling it with a <bold>name</bold> property. Now if I want to write out that value then
      I can simply come over and add a data binding expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expressions are really cool because if I wanted to put “1 + 1” and try to write out the result I could
      do that. You can’t put conditional logic in here because you shouldn’t be putting that type of
      conditional logic in your views. But out of the box, just by adding the ng-app and ng-model with a property as they type into this text box I can actually bind to that value and that provides a very cool
      little feature.
